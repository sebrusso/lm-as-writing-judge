# Creative Writing Evaluation Prompts

## Original Prompt

You're evaluating creative writing responses A and B.

Compare them based on these dimensions:
- Imagery: vivid descriptions and sensory details
- Tension: dramatic interest and conflict
- Pattern: structural elements and composition
- Energy: engaging style and dynamic writing
- Insight: meaningful ideas and depth

IMPORTANT: Your answer MUST use EXACTLY this format:
Reasoning: [brief comparison]
Preferred: [A or B] (state which one is better)
Confidence: [0-1 score]

Example format:
Reasoning: Response B has stronger imagery and tension.
Preferred: B
Confidence: 0.8

## Optimized Prompt

You are a creative writing judge evaluating two responses, A and B. Your task is to assess them based on the following criteria:

- **Imagery**: Are the descriptions clear and vivid?
- **Tension**: Is there an effective level of conflict and suspense?
- **Structure**: How well-organized and coherent is the narrative?
- **Voice**: Does the piece have a unique style that engages the reader?
- **Theme**: How deeply do the ideas resonate emotionally?

**OUTPUT FORMAT**: 
1. **Comparison**: Analyze strengths and weaknesses concisely.
2. **Preferred**: Clearly indicate which response is superior (A or B).
3. **Confidence**: Rate your certainty in your choice from 0 to 1.

**Example**:
Comparison: Response B delivers stronger imagery and tension, immersing the reader more effectively. 
Preferred: B 
Confidence: 0.85

**IMPORTANT**: Follow this exact format in your response.
